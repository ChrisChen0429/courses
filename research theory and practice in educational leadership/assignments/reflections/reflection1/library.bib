abstract = {In more than four decades of studying businesses and consulting to organizations on how to implement new strategies, I can't tell you how many times I've heard people use the words “leadership” and “management” synonymously, and it drives me crazy every time. The interview reminded me once again that the confusion around these two terms is massive, and that misunderstanding gets in the way of any reasonable discussion about how to build a company, position it for success and win in the twenty-first century. The mistakes people make on the issue are threefold:},

abstract = {This case is developed for use in a policy-centered course on systemic improvement in underperforming districts and schools. The narrative details the complexity that arose in the context of one such reform initiative, a framework for analyzing that complexity, and a set of leadership decisions that follow. Course instructors can use the case to: motivate students' interest in district-driven systemic improvement, examine issues that often complicate such work, review emerging research on school turnaround efforts, and frame further inquiry into actual cases of district-driven systemic improvement.},

@article{Richmon2003,
abstract = {This article offers a critical examination of academic work in the area of leadership over the past several decades, arguing that the lack of conceptual clarity in the field hinders practitioners' efforts to discriminate among competing theoretical perspectives. In an effort to address this problem, as well as to reflect on the rich history of the field, several notable reviews and compendia of leadership literature are considered with a view towards examining the strengths and weaknesses of existing schemes for categorizing and classifying scholarly approaches to leadership. The article concludes with a brief description of an original conceptual framework for leadership inquiry, and suggests how such a framework might be used to identify, describe and possibly integrate persistent conceptual similarities and differences across distinct theoretical perspectives.},

@article{Simonet2013,
abstract = {How management and leadership are best conceptualized with respect to each other has been a frequent topic of debate. Five distinct perspectives are identified in the literature, including bipolar, unidimensional, bidimensional, hierarchical— management within leadership, and hierarchical—leadership within management. We assessed the viability of these perspectives by having Academy of Management and Society for Industrial/Organizational Psychology experts (N = 43) map a comprehensive set of 63 managerial and leadership competencies, as a “common language,” onto defined and undefined management and leadership dimensions. Results reveal interpretable patterns of uniqueness and overlap, suggesting a hybrid co-dimensional/bidimensional configuration. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed in light of the precedence of “what” over “how” in developing leadership and management theory.},

@article{Levin2006,
abstract = {There is wide consensus that opportunities for student learning depend crucially on educational leadership and teacher quality. These two areas dominate national, state, and local efforts at building capacity to meet new educational standards and are also central to the efforts of universities and philanthropic foundations to improve education. Until recently, educational leadership was generally subsumed under the ﬁeld of educational administration. The traditional model of education called for policy to be set by states and local school boards and for implementation to be carried out by educational administrators and their staffs. To the degree that the term educational leadership was used, it was predominantly associated with the direct management of schools and school districts; educational policy formation was viewed as being separate from educational leadership.},
