C


# Visualization:
library(graphics)
mosaicplot(teen.table, main = "Mosaic Plot of Teen Sex")
# Widths are proportional to marginal probabilities r
# Heights are proportional to conditional probabilities R
# If there is independence bars should be approximately the same

# Same applies to the other conditional given columns:
mosaicplot(t(teen.table), xlab = "Age Group")

# Conclusion: The two variables seem to be dependent.

fviz_ca_biplot(fit, repel = TRUE)
# the standard plot of correspondence analysis is a symmetric biplot in which both 
# rows (blue points) and columns (red triangles) are represented in the same space 
# using the principal coordinates. 
# Rows or columns close together have similar profiles
# With symmetric plot, the inter-distance between rows and columns canâ€™t be interpreted.

fviz_ca_biplot(fit,

               repel = TRUE)
# To make an asymetric biplot, rows (or columns) points are plotted from the 
# standard coordinates and the profiles of the columns (or the rows) are plotted from 
# the principale coordinates  

# If the angle between two arrows is acute, 
# then their is a strong association between the corresponding row and column.


## Algebra:
# Matrix formula for conditional given rows:
solve(diag(r)) %*% P

# Matrix formula for conditional given columns
P%*%solve(diag(c))

# Testing independence with the Chi-square test:
(chisq = chisq.test(teen.table))

# Warning because there are some expected counts < 5
chisq$expected

# In such case we can compute p-value with a Monte Carlo simulation:
chisq.test(teen.table, simulate.p.value = T)

# Conclusion: Since p-value < 0.05 reject the H0 of independence
# Matches with our visual interpretation

# Test statistic value
chisq$statistic

# Cross-check with algebraic formula:
n*sum(diag(solve(diag(r)) %*% (P - r%*%t(c)) %*% solve(diag(c)) %*% t(P - r%*%t(c))))


## Row and column profiles

Z = sqrt(solve(diag(r))) %*% (P - r%*%t(c))   %*% sqrt(solve(diag(c)))
