16. In addition to specific examples from the APA manual below, also
    see the table checklist on p. 150.
 (a) APA Manual (p. 113): Do not use a zero before 
      a decimal fraction when the statistic cannot be greater than
      1.
 (b) APA Manual (p. 113): Use a zero before the decimal 
      point with numbers that are less than 1 when the statis­tic can 
      exceed 1.
 (c) APA Manual (p. 113): The number of decimal places 
      to use in reporting the results of experiments and data analytic
      manipulations of the data should be governed by the following 
      general principle: Round as much as possible while keeping 
      prospective use and statistical pre­ cision in mind. As a general
      rule, fewer decimal digits are easier to comprehend than more digits; 
      therefore, in general, it is better to round to two decimal places or 
      to rescale the measurement
 (d) APA Manual (p. 114): When reporting p values, report 
      exact p values (e.g., p = .031) to two or three dec­ imal places. 
      However, report p values less than .001 as p < .001.
 (e) APA Manual (p. 128): Tables should be integral to the text but 
      should be designed so that they can be understood in isolation.
 (f) APA Manual (p. 133): Give every table a brief but clear and 
      explanatory title. The basic content of the table should be easily
      inferred from the title.
 (g) APA Manual (p. 134): Abbreviations of technical terms, group names,
      and the like must be explained in the table title or in a note to 
      the table.
 (h) APA Manual (p. 137): The table body contains the data. Express numerical
      values to the number of decimal places that the precision of measurement
      justifies (see section 4.35), and if possible, carry all comparable 
      values to the same number of decimal places.
 (i) APA Manual (p. 141): Limit the use of rules (i.e., lines) in a table 
      to those that are necessary for clarity. Appropriately positioned 
      white space can be an effective substitute for rules.

17a. The pairwise correlations between the group variable and all other
      variables are expected to be nil because the group was randomized.
17b. The correlation betwen pk1 and pk5 (.71) indicates a strong linear
      relationship between pretest and posttest, which suggests pretest 
      is a suitable covariate.
17c. The pairwise correlation between pk1 and group is negative, indicating
      that the treatment group had less pain at baseline. Thus, controlling
      for pretest will tend to pull the adjusted mean of the treated group 
      up and the adjusted mean of the control group down.

18. The one-way ANOVA output given for the acupuncture data tests the omnibus
     null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean headache severity
     across the groups after 1 year. Given a Type I error rate of .05, we 
     reject the null hypothesis (F(1,299) = 11.83; p = .0007) and conclude 
     that there is evidence of a difference in headache severity at one year.
     (See p. 127 in the APA manual for an example.)

19. The effect of acupuncture treatment on headache severity is moderated
     by baseline headache severity. As an example, condition on pretest
     severity ratings of, say, 20 and 60. The prediction equation for 
     pk1 = 60 is as follows: pk5_i = 1.35 + .69*60 + (.96 - .13*60)*group
                             pk5_i = 1.35 + .69*60 - 6.84*group
     pk1 = 20 is as follows: pk5_i = 1.35 + .69*20 + (.96 - .13*20)*group
                             pk5_i = 1.35 + .69*60 - 1.64*group
     Thus, we can see that the effect of acupuncture is to reduce headache
     severity by 1.64 points on average for those with pretest headache 
     severity score of 20; whereas, the effect of acupuncture is to reduce
     headache severity by 6.84 points for those with pretest headache
     severity score of 60. These specific examples illustrate the general
     trend that the efficacy of acupuncture in reducing headache severity 
     increases with increasing baseline headache severity. This may be 
     validated by examining the plot, which shows predicted lines fanning
     out as baseline severity increases.
