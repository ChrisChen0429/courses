13. F; it violates the analytic requirement of no multicollinearity
14. T; with dummy coding the intercept represent the mean of the reference group (here group 3) and the slope on the remaining groups represent their respective deviations from the reference group; so, the intercept plus the slope on group 1 dummy will give the mean for the first group
15. T
16. F; the contrast coefficients must add up to zero and here 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 2; possible solutions include (1, -1/2, -1/2) or (-1, 1/2, 1/2); we will cover this material on Monday 10/14

18. F; t distribution is symmetric, F distribution is skewed right; we haven't covered this material
19. F; the SE for a contrast depends on (a) the residual SE, (b) the group sample sizes, and (c) the contrast coefficients; we will cover this material on Monday 10/14

37. In addition to specific examples from the APA manual below, also
    see the table checklist on p. 150.
 (a) APA Manual (p. 113): Do not use a zero before 
      a decimal fraction when the statistic cannot be greater than
      1.
 (b) APA Manual (p. 113): Use a zero before the decimal 
      point with numbers that are less than 1 when the statis­tic can 
      exceed 1.
 (c) APA Manual (p. 113): The number of decimal places 
      to use in reporting the results of experiments and data analytic
      manipulations of the data should be governed by the following 
      general principle: Round as much as possible while keeping 
      prospective use and statistical pre­ cision in mind. As a general
      rule, fewer decimal digits are easier to comprehend than more digits; 
      therefore, in general, it is better to round to two decimal places or 
      to rescale the measurement
 (d) APA Manual (p. 114): When reporting p values, report 
      exact p values (e.g., p = .031) to two or three dec­ imal places. 
      However, report p values less than .001 as p < .001.
 (e) APA Manual (p. 128): Tables should be integral to the text but 
      should be designed so that they can be understood in isolation.
 (f) APA Manual (p. 133): Give every table a brief but clear and 
      explanatory title. The basic content of the table should be easily
      inferred from the title.
 (g) APA Manual (p. 134): Abbreviations of technical terms, group names,
      and the like must be explained in the table title or in a note to 
      the table.
 (h) APA Manual (p. 137): The table body contains the data. Express numerical
      values to the number of decimal places that the precision of measurement
      justifies (see section 4.35), and if possible, carry all comparable 
      values to the same number of decimal places.
 (i) APA Manual (p. 141): Limit the use of rules (i.e., lines) in a table 
      to those that are necessary for clarity. Appropriately positioned 
      white space can be an effective substitute for rules.
38. You could make the case for either approach here. Graphically, there 
    doesn't appear to much going on in the way of interaction here. Nevertheless,
    the p-value for the test of interaction is .08, which is suggestive. Note
    that the sample size here is very large (n = 7362), so even small deviations
    from parallel relationships will be picked up as significant, so my preference
    would be to analyze as if there is no two-way interaction given the plot. But, 
    again, you could make the case either way so long as you use appropriate 
    evidence. Option 1 (my preferred option): I would test pairwise comparisons of
    the parent status factor, averaging over the levels of head start. Option 2 
    (also acceptable if argued appropriately): test the simple effects of parental
    status for (a) those who received head start and (b) those who did not separately.    
39. Option 1: Averaging across the levels of head start, we find significant 
    differences between all three levels of the parental status factor. In particular,
    the mean of the other group is 10.5 points higher than the mean of the one parent
    group (p < .001); the mean of the other group is 5.6 points higher than the mean of
    the step parent group (p = .0003); and the mean f the one parent group is 4.91 
    points lower than the mean of the step parent group (p = .003).

FORMULAS TO KNOW:
-Incremental F test
-df = Sample size - Number of parameters estimated
-df_F
-df_R
-df_numerator = df_R - df_F
-df_denominator = df_F
-Regression model formulas including those with categorical predictors, 
  continuous predictors, interactions between cat and cat predictors (i.e.,
  two-way ANOVA) interactions betweeen cat and contin predictors, dummy
  coding and effect coding interpretations of coefficients.
- Also need to know how to create contrasts with contrast coefficients and
  how to interpret them.
- Know how to estimate the residual standard error (sigma^2_epsilon) with data.
