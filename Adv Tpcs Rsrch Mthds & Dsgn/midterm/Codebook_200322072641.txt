Name:       SCH_ID
Position:   73
Length:     4
Label:      School ID

Description:
School ID provides linkage to school-level information. For base-year
schools, school ID includes the 3-digit stratum (STRAT_ID) variable
and 1-digit PSU  concatenated together.  See descriptions of STRAT_ID
and PSU.
Note: For schools added since the base-year component, a school ID
was assigned using numbers outside the 3-digit stratum and 1-digit
PSU range. The 3-digit stratum ranges from 100 to 461 and the 1-digit
PSU ranges from 1 to 3.  School IDs added since the Base Year are
not associated with strata and PSUs, thus values were created
avoiding already existing values associated with strata and PSUs.
Transfer school IDs can be identified as school IDs ranging from
5004 to 7145. New schools, which are schools that split off from
the base-year schools by the first follow-up, were assigned
school IDs ranging from 9995 to 9999. School IDs were added for new
schools in the First Follow-up and transfer schools in the transcript
component. These new schools are identified on the student file in
F1RSCH2 and F1RSCHL, and can be linked from the student file to
SCH_ID on the school file in order to obtain more school information.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time.  This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Name:       STRAT_ID
Position:   77
Length:     3
Label:      Stratum

Description:
This variable is a component of the ELS:2002 base-year school ID
(first three digits). The STRAT_ID is not available for schools
added since the base-year. STRAT_ID indicates the analysis
stratum to be used for computing Taylor Series variance estimates.
The analysis strata were formed  from the sampling strata used in the
first stage of sampling. This STRAT_ID is developed at the school
level and copied to the student level. This school level STRAT_ID
should be used when generating school  estimates.  In order to support
improved variance estimation, a  larger number of strata (with fewer
PSUs per stratum -- up to 3 PSUs per stratum) are used in ELS:2002,
compared to NELS:88 or HS&B. See section 3.5 of the ELS:2002 Base Year
Data File User's Manual.

Label:      Trash on front hallway floors

Description:
   1. Standing at the main entrance into the school, observe the
   school's front hallway(s) during a time when most students are in
   class (i.e., a class period). Take as much time as necessary to
   observe the hallway(s). For each item listed, indicate whether you
   observed it or not.
   (MARK ONE RESPONSE ON EACH LINE)
   (Yes, observed; No, did not observe)
   a. Trash on the floors
Note:  This is one of a series of items, a through j.
Note: This school level variable is replicated on the student file
      for all BY eligible sample members.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB.  This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time.  This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.
Applies to:All Schools.

Label:      Student ID

Description:
Student ID is composed of the 4-digit School ID (which consists of
the 3-digit stratum and 1-digit PSU) and a 2-digit sequential
student code within school.
Stratum (STRAT_ID) and PSU are embedded in STU_ID for ease of use
in certain variance estimation programs.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard-copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated-version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Description:
This variable is a component of the ELS:2002 school ID (first three
digits). It indicates the analysis stratum to be used for computing
Taylor Series variance estimates. The analysis strata were formed
from the sampling strata used in the first stage of sampling. STRAT_ID
is developed at the school level and replicated at the student level.
This school level STRAT_ID should be used when generating school
estimates. In order to support improved variance estimation, a
larger number of strata (with fewer PSUs per stratum -- up to 3 PSUs
per stratum) are used in ELS:2002, compared to NELS:88 or HS&B. See
section 3.5 of the ELS:2002 Base Year Data File User's Manual.

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year and first follow-up
status of sample members. This variable has valid values that
account for every pattern encountered by ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status followed by F1 status.
Definition of BY component within value label
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent with the following trailing
       characters meaning:
       A=In-school, in grade
       B=In-School out-of-grade
       D=Dropout
       F=Freshened
       E=Received HS diploma early (on or before 3/15/2004)
       G=Received GED/HS equivalent early (on or before 3/15/2004)
       H=Homeschooled
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F1UNIV1 = 101 relate to sample members with
the following participation patterns:  "BYR F1RA" In other words,
the sample members were BY respondents and F1 respondents
in-School/in grade.
Note: F1ESSTAT and F1NRSTAT are variables used below in the SAS code
that are available only on the restricted use ECB. Their logic is
applicable to sample members in the restricted use file only.
SAS Code:
  If F1UNIV2A in (3) then do; /* BYX */

Label:      Sample member status in first 3 rounds

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year, first follow-up, and second
follow-up status of each sample member. This variable has values that
account for all possible status patterns of ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status, F1 status, and F2 status,
respectively.
Definition of BY component within value label:
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label:
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
Definition of F2 component within value label:
   F2R=Second Follow-up Respondent
   F2NR=Second Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F2OD= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F2OS= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F2UNIV1=101 (BYR F1R F2R) relate to sample
members who were respondents in the base year, first follow-up, and
second follow-up surveys.

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year, first follow-up, and second
follow-up status of each sample member. This variable has values that
account for all possible status patterns of ELS:2002 sample members.
Value labels indicate BY status, F1 status, and F2 status,
respectively.
Definition of BY component within value label:
   BYR=Base Year Respondent
   BYN=Base Year Nonrespondent
   BYI=Base Year Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded Sample only)
   BNA=Base Year Not Applicable (i.e., Freshened 12th-grader in the
       first follow-up)
Definition of F1 component within value label:
   F1R=First Follow-up Respondent
   F1NR=First Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F1IE=First Follow-up Questionnaire Ineligible (i.e., Expanded
        Sample only)
   F1OD=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F1OS=First Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
Definition of F2 component within value label:
   F2R=Second Follow-up Respondent
   F2NR=Second Follow-up Nonrespondent
   F2OD= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Deceased)
   F2OS= Second Follow-up Out of Scope (Other)
For example, cases where F2UNIV1=101 (BYR F1R F2R) relate to sample
members who were respondents in the base year, first follow-up, and
second follow-up surveys.
Note: F2UNIV_P is the public-use version of the restricted-use F2
composite variable F2UNIV1. For disclosure avoidance purposes,
F2UNIV_P combines all categories in F2UNIV1 with low cell counts ("BYR
F1IE F2R", "BYN F1IE F2R", "BNA F1IE F2R", "BYI F1R F2OS", and "BYI
F1IE F2NR") into a single "Other" category.

Description:
Indicates simultaneously the base year, first follow-up, second follow-up and third follow-up response status of sample members belonging to the 12th grade cohort. The high school transcript population is also represented. This variable has values that account for all possible binary response status patterns (respondent vs. nonrespondent) of ELS:2002 sample members across all rounds. It should be noted that a designation of nonrespondent in the context of this variable represents all varieties of nonresponse including sample members that were out of the country, incapacitated, institutionalized, refused, could not be located or were otherwise out-of-scope.

Label:      Spring 2004 senior cohort member

Description:
This variable indicates whether the sample member is a Senior cohort
member, i.e., a spring 2004 12th-grader. F1-identified senior
cohort members include F1 respondents at base year schools, as well as
those who transferred, if they indicated they were 12th-graders.
Spring 2004 grade was imputed where missing for F1 respondents (see
also F1GRADE/F2F1GRDE). G12COHRT has also been updated since the
first follow-up version to identify F1 nonrespondents whose second
follow-up or transcript information indicates they were in fact spring
2004 12th-graders. Values of 2 also include freshened cases who
were F1 questionnaire-ineligible.
Use G12COHRT in concert with F1, transcript, or F2 weights to get an
appropriately weighted sample that generalizes to the 2004 spring term
senior class. For example, G12COHRT=1 used with F1QWT generates
estimates for a nationally representative, cross-sectional population
of the 2004 spring term senior class. G12CHORT>0 used with F2F1WT
generates estimates for a nationally representative panel of the
spring term senior class, including F1 nonrespondents.
SAS Code:
If G12COHRT = 0 And F1NRSTAT > 0 Then Do;
   If F2F1GRDE=12 Then G12COHRT=2;

Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the
routing suggests that a response should have been provided.

Label:      Math test standardized score

Description:
Math standardized T Score. The standardized T score provides a norm-
referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of
achievement relative to the population (spring 2002 10th-graders) as a
whole. It provides information on status compared to peers (as
distinguished from the IRT-estimated number-right score which
represents status with respect to achievement on a particular
criterion set of test items). The standardized T score is a
transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, rescaled to a mean
of 50 and standard deviation of 10.
To determine the quartile cut-points, the weighted distribution of
the standardized scores was divided at the 25th, 50th, and 75th
percentiles. Cut points were matched to unrounded standardized
scores. Resulting quartiles will not always be exactly 25% of the
weighted base year sample due to rounding. Because standardized
scores are rounded, some resulting values near the cut point may
appear in more than one quartile.

safety. Variable was created through principal factor analysis
(weighted by BYSTUWT) and standardized to a mean of 0 and standard
deviation of 1. Only respondents who provided a full set of responses
were assigned a scale value. The coefficient of reliability (alpha)
for the scale is 0.64.

Length:     7
Label:      BY Academic climate scale

Description:
This variable is a scale of the base-year school administrator?s
perceptions of the school?s academic climate. Higher values represent
perceptions of a more academically-oriented climate. Variable was
created through principal factor analysis, weighted by BYSCHWT. Only
administrators who provided a full set of responses were assigned a
scale value, which was then linked to all students within the sampled
school. To distinguish administrator-based scales from student-based
scales, this variable was not standardized. The coefficient of
reliability (alpha) for the scale is 0.86.
Note: This composite is constructed from Administrator Questionnaire
variables; thus, values of -4 (nonrespondent), -8 (survey component
legitimate skip), and -9 refer to missing data from the Administrator
Questionnaire.

Length:     10
Label:      First follow-up questionnaire (cross-sectional) weight

Description:
This weight applies to all first follow-up respondents, regardless
of their participation status in the base year. When used with the
appropriate sample flags (selection criteria appear in parentheses
below), it allows projections to the following populations:
     -Spring 2002 10th-graders capable of completing questionnaires
     in 2004, regardless of 2002 participation (G10COHRT=1)
          or
     -Spring 2004 12th-graders capable of completing questionnaires
     in 2004 regardless of 2002 participation (G12COHRT=1).
For additional information, see section 3.4 in the ELS:2002
Base Year to First Follow-Up Data File Use's Manual.
Note: The following reserve codes are used throughout the ECB. This
description is added to the first variable of each section to help
users understand the meaning of each reserve code.
-1: "Don't know" represents respondents who indicated that they didn't
know the answer to the question.
-2: "Refused" represents respondents who indicated that they refused
to answer the question
-3: "Item legitimate skip/NA" is filled for questions that are not
administered based on routing logic; i.e., the items are not
applicable based on responses to prior questions.
-4: "Nonrespondent" is filled for all variables across the entire
questionnaire when a sample member did not respond to the
questionnaire.
-5: "Out of range" represents questionnaire respondents who
reported values that are out of range.
-6: "Multiple response" represents hard copy questionnaire respondents
who reported more than one response for an item that requires
only one response.
-7: "Partial interview-breakoff" is filled for questions that are not
answered because the respondent does not wish to continue the
interview or they have run out of time. This also includes particular
items that are not included on an abbreviated version questionnaire.
-8: "Survey component legitimate skip/NA" is filled for all items
within a survey component for sample members who were not administered
that component by design for one of the following reasons:  1) the
component was not administered based on their status (e.g., transfer
students did not receive certain items on the in-school survey), 2)
the sample member was not a part of the study at the time of
administration (e.g., first follow-up freshened sample members were by
definition not eligible for the base-year survey), or 3) the sample
member was not capable of completing the survey component (e.g.,
students who were questionnaire-ineligible due to a language barrier
or disability at the time of the survey).
-9: "Missing" is filled for questions that are not answered when the

Label:      Panel Weight, BY and F1 (2002 and 2004)

Description:
This panel weight applies to sample members who were respondents in
both the ELS:2002 base year (2002) and first follow-up (2004) surveys
or who were respondents in the first follow-up only but have imputed
base year data. This weight can be used when comparing base year data
with first follow-up data for the population of questionnaire-eligible
spring 2002 10th-graders. For additional information, see
section 3.4 of the ELS:2002 Base Year to First Follow-Up Data File

Label:      F1 expanded sample weight (restricted)

Description:
This weight applies to sample members who are in the first follow-up
expanded sample. The first follow-up expanded sample includes
questionnaire-capable respondents and questionnaire-incapable sample
members. Questionnaire-incapable sample members were excused from
completion of the questionnaire or the test when (for reasons of
their lack of proficiency in English or severe disabilities) they
could not validly be assessed or complete a questionnaire, or could
only be surveyed under conditions that would be unduly arduous or
uncomfortable for them. When used with the appropriate sample
flags (selection criteria appear in parentheses below), it allows
projections to the following populations:
     -Spring 2002 10th-graders, regardless of 2002 participation
     (G10COHRT=1)
          or
     -Spring 2004 12th-graders, regardless of 2002 participation
     (G12COHRT=1).

Description:
This panel weight applies to expanded sample members who were
respondents in both rounds of ELS:2002, those who were only
respondents in the first follow-up but have base year data imputed,
or those who were incapable of completing the questionnaire in the
base year and/or first follow-up. This weight can be used when
comparing base year data with first follow-up data for the
population of questionnaire-eligible and questionnaire-ineligible
spring 2002 10th-graders.

Label:      F1 math standardized score

Description:
Math standardized T Score. The standardized T score provides a norm-
referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of
achievement relative to the population (spring 2004 12th-graders) as a
whole. It provides information on status compared with peers (as
distinguished from the IRT-estimated number-right score which
represents status with respect to achievement on a particular
criterion set of test items). Although the T score is reported for
all F1 in-school responding students (including transfer students),
regardless of grade level, the comparison group
for standardizing is the 12th grade population. The standardized
T score is a transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, and
has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the weighted subset
of 12th-graders in the sample.
The following types of cases were not imputed for F1TXMSTD: Dropouts,
Early Graduates, Homeschoolers, F1 nonrespondents, out of scope
cases, and questionnaire-ineligible cases.
