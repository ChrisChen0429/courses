Dick$\backslash$nSnow's research on aptitudeâ€“treatment interactions (ATIs) was designed to investigate and$\backslash$nquantify these effects, and more recent research in this vein has clearly established that these effects$\backslash$ncan be quantified and predicted. Technology has now reached a point where we have the$\backslash$nopportunity to capitalize on these effects to the benefit of learners. In this article, we review$\backslash$nsome of the demonstrated effects of ATIs, describe how ATI research naturally leads to adaptive$\backslash$ne-learning, and describe one way in which an adaptive e-learning system might be implemented$\backslash$nto take advantage of these effects.},

abstract = {In the globalized economies e-permeation has become a basic condition in our everyday lives. ICT can no longer be understood solely as artefacts and tools and computer-related literacy are no longer restricted to the ability to operate digital tools for specific purposes. The network society, and therefore also eLearning are characterized by fluidity and the key competence for social actors in this ever changing e-permeated environment is the ability to cope with change - or Castells' conceptualisation self-programming. Castells' theory has influenced international definitions of future key competencies. Both lifelong learning and digital literacy understood as bildung have emerged as central for the definitions of and standards for future key competencies. However, definitions and standards only tell us about the desired destination and outcome of digital competence building. They tell us nothing about how we may get there. In the educational system ICT and e-learning are becoming an everyday condition and the basic challenge for the educational system is twofold: 1) The actually making of digital literate and self-programming social actors - students and teachers; and 2) How to develop adequate designs for teaching and learning for that purpose. We need research that aims to describe the phenomenology of acquiring digital literacy and self-programming in order to be able to identify relevant learning objectives and scaffolding. Findings from such studies are expected to be relevant for eLearning scenarios as well as for ICT and designs for learning in general. This paper presents a case study that aimed to explore the phenomenological appearance of self-programming as agency and learning among postgraduate students who participated in a specially designed eLearning workshop in the autumn 2009. The findings relate to both the individual and collaborative barriers and proactive strategies that come into play among the students. Drawing on the findings, it is argued that the presented workshop design contributes to the networked society's design for ICT, teaching and learning, as the design - at least for this small group of students - have proved to support the development of digital self-programming as a sustainable competence. In the autumn 2010 the study will be expanded to a larger group of students. {\textcopyright} Academic Publishing International Ltd.},

abstract = {Self-directed learning is a core theoretical construct distinguishing adult education as a field of study. Most of the concept's emphasis has been on the external control and management of learning tasks. In an attempt to expand the scope of self-directed learning, this paper presents a comprehensive theoretical model. The prooposed model integrates self-management (contextual control), self-monitoring (cogntive responsibility), and motivational (entering and task) dimension to reflect a meaningful and worthwhile approach to self-directed learning. Explicating the cognitive and motivational dimenstions of self-directed learning is identified as an area requiring further research.},

@article{Brookfield1993,
abstract = {This paper argues that reframing the concept of self-direction as an inherently political idea comprises an important strategic opening in building a critical practice of adult education. Instead of being equated with atomistic self-gratification, self-direction can be interpreted as part of a cultural tradition that emphasizes the individual's standing against repressive interests. As such, the concept has some powerful political underpinnings which, if made explicit, could play a significant role in awakening the critical spirit in American adult education. Two inherently political dimensions of the idea are discussed: first, the recognition that at the intellectual heart of self-direction are issues of control and power that are inescapably political; second, the claim that any authentic exercise of self-directedness requires that certain political conditions be in place.},
